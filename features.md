## 🦋 Future Feature: Papillon Governance Wrapper

Papillon AI is **architected from the start with an optional logical/governance layer in mind**—designed to be added as a **separate wrapper extension** without invasive changes to the core assistant. This keeps Papillon AI fast and developer-friendly by default, while enabling a governed, enterprise-ready mode when needed.

### Current limitations (governance gaps)

* ❌ No centralized task approval workflow
* ❌ No policy enforcement layer
* ❌ No audit trail for AI actions
* ❌ No resource usage controls
* ❌ No output filtering/sanitization
* ❌ No compliance checking
* ❌ No role-based access control

## Governance Layer Architecture

### Design Approach: Wrapper Extension Pattern

** Implement governance as a separate VS Code extension that **wraps Papillon AI**.

**Rationale**

* ✅ Non-invasive: doesn’t modify core Papillon AI code
* ✅ Maintainable: updated independently
* ✅ Testable: validated in isolation
* ✅ Flexible: enabled/disabled per workspace
* ✅ Upgradeable: Papillon AI can evolve without breaking governance

### How it fits Papillon’s architecture

Papillon AI exposes its capabilities (chat, edits, agentic flows) via commands/APIs in a way that a wrapper can:

1. intercept requests,
2. enforce policy/logic,
3. log actions,
4. gate approvals, and
5. forward allowed actions to Papillon AI.

This ensures Papillon can operate in two modes:

* **Un-governed**: lightweight developer experience (default)
* **Governed**: policy-driven workflows with approvals, auditing, and controls (optional)
